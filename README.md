# (Almost) Perfect Life Simulation

*A Simulation of what I think the year 2200 will look like. Created with Python and Electron*

## How the backend works:

The most important thing is a city. In a city there are families / groups of people.
Every person has an account, with which they can log into a computer. On that computer
they can do many things. For example, they can take a look at the status of their
bank account. All the money is online, that's safer. If you wnat to earn money,
you can do that by getting a job at a company. Of course you can also create your own
company. You don't have to work at a company to earn money, every city has jobs too.
Every job is on the Job-Board. There you can search, filter, ... jobs. With the money
you can buy things.
As a children, you have to go to school. The school is mostly on the computer, but often
there are events in Real Life. There are many different kinds of schools for different kids.
There is only one school that you visit for your whole life. Of course you can change the school
you go to. If you want to learn more after school, you have to go to an university which costs
(not much) money.
If you're 18 years old, you can get your own building plot. There are ones in
different sizes which cost a different amount of money (but not too much).
If you want to build a house, you have to pay a company to do that. After that, you can always
sell your plot to other people.
